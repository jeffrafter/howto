# How to

I've long been under the illusion that building websites is easy and that just about anyone can do it. I am still under that illusion of course (please see the previous sentence), but more and more I have found that doing it requires a lot of reference. This is a attempt at keeping all of my references and decisions in one place.

Please note: much of this should be considered wrong. Also, very much of it will be suboptimal. The goal is to build something that performs reasonably well while maximizing the ability to make changes.

Also, I break all of my own rules all the time.
